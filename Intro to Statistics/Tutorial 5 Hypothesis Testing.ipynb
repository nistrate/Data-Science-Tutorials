    "# Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful procedure when making statistical decisions about a dataset is *hypothesis testing*. Through hypothesis testing we are able to make an assumption about the population parameters. When performing such testing, we evaluate two mutually exclusive statements about a population in order to determine which one is better supported by the gathered sample data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Null hypothesis** $H_{0}$ : is a statement of no difference between sample means or proportions or no difference between a sample mean or proportion and a population mean or proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The alternative hypothesis** $H_{\\alpha}$: is a claim about the population that is contradictory to $H_{0}$ and what we conclude whenwe reject $H_{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ha: The alternative hypothesis: It is a claim about the population that is contradictory to $H_{0}$ and what we conclude whenwe reject $H_{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have determined which hypothesis the sample supports, you make a decision. There are two options for a\n",
    "decision. They are \"reject $H_{0}$\" if the sample information favors the alternative hypothesis or \"do not reject H0\" or \"decline\n",
    "to reject $H_{0}$\" if the sample information is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful quantity in hypothesis testing is **significance level**, $\\alpha$. This quantity describes significance (in percent) for which we accept or reject $H_{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the nature of sampling, significance level, along with other causes, one could commit errors when performing *hypothesis testing*. There are two types of errors that can occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Type I error**, also known as a false positive, occurs when a one incorrectly rejects a true null hypothesis. This means that your report that your findings are significant when in fact they have occurred by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Type II error**,  also known as a false negative, occurs when a one fails to reject a null hypothesis which is really false. This means that your report that your findings don't have a significant effect, when they really do have an effect.\n"

    "**Problem:** Hypothesis Testing: Worldwide Nutrition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem you will work with the same dataset as in Lab IV. The goal of this lab is to perform hypothesis testing on a food category from the dataset. Your baseline year will be $1961$, which means that your worlwide population mean will be extracted from here. The hypothesis testing will be performed with samples from all the other years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission, if you chose to accept it, is to develop a function that will:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Present your null hypothesis $H_{0}$.\n",
    "2.   Given an sample from a different year, present your alternative hypothesis $H_{\\alpha}$.\n",
    "3.   Perform the hypothesis testing for a reasonable sample size $n$, and output a decision regarding $H_0$.\n",
    "4.   Indicate the type of error that one could make given set decision. (Don't just say 'Type 1' or 'Type 2', but actuallly articulate it.)\n",
    "5.   Chose a case in which you accepted $H_0$, decrease the sample size $n$, and repeat the analysis.\n",
    "6.   Chose a case in which you rejected $H_0$, increse the sample size $n$, and repeat the analysis.\n",
    "7.   Analyze and describe the results that you`re observing. In other words, imagine that you're working for WHO and you're goal is to summarize your results for the general public\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that your $\\alpha$ is a parameter in your function. A good choice for it is $\\alpha  = 5 \\%$, however feel free to use other values as long as you're confident about their meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your function ready consider running it by using samples from the following years:\n",
