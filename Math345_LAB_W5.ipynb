        "A useful procedure when making statistical decisions about a dataset is *hypothesis testing*. Through hypothesis testing we are able to make an assumption about the population parameters. When performing such testing, we evaluate two mutually exclusive statements about a population in order to determine which one is better supported by the gathered sample data. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Null hypothesis** $H_{0}$ : is a statement of no difference between sample means or proportions or no difference between a sample mean or proportion and a population mean or proportion.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**The alternative hypothesis** $H_{\\alpha}$: is a claim about the population that is contradictory to $H_{0}$ and what we conclude whenwe reject $H_{0}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ha: The alternative hypothesis: It is a claim about the population that is contradictory to $H_{0}$ and what we conclude whenwe reject $H_{0}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "After you have determined which hypothesis the sample supports, you make a decision. There are two options for a\n",
        "decision. They are \"reject $H_{0}$\" if the sample information favors the alternative hypothesis or \"do not reject H0\" or \"decline\n",
        "to reject $H_{0}$\" if the sample information is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another useful quantity in hypothesis testing is **significance level**, $\\alpha$. This quantity describes significance (in percent) for which we accept or reject $H_{0}$.\n"

Your baseline year will be $1961$, which means that your worlwide population mean will be extracted from here. The hypothesis testing will be performed with samples from all the other years. \n",

        "Make sure that your $\\alpha$ is a parameter in your function. A good choice for it is $\\alpha  = 5 \\%$, however feel free to use other values as long as you're confident about their meaning.\n",
